This repository introduces us to the compilation process of a c code

0. Takes a c file through the preprocessor without compiling by using the -E flag
1. Command compiles a C file but does not link by using the flag -c( and obj file is produced)
2. command compiles a c file but does not assemble (creates an assembly code .s)
